# Simple Wordle Game (Terminal-based)

A simple terminal-based Wordle game written in Python.

## 🧠 How It Works

- Randomly picks a 5-letter word from `/usr/share/dict/words`.
- You have **6 attempts** to guess the correct word.
- After each guess, you'll get color-coded feedback:
  - 🟩 **Green** – correct letter in the correct position
  - 🟨 **Yellow** – correct letter in the wrong position
  - ⬛ **Black** – incorrect letter
